## In one sentence

On a matched, memoryless two-hop relay channel a classical decode-and-forward relay is not improved on by any learned relay evaluated here, while on channels whose memory or impairments fall outside that model a compact learned relay restores reliable relaying — without ever overtaking a correctly informed classical sequence detector.
**Source:** `chapters/ch09_summary.tex`, closing paragraph — "A compact learned relay supplies useful amortized processing where the modelling or estimation requirements of the particular classical receiver it is measured against are not met".

## Research question

> Under what channel-information and channel-memory conditions can a learned relay improve upon or complement classical AF/DF processing in two-hop wireless communication?

**Source:** `chapters/ch01_introduction.tex`, §Scope — the thesis frames two questions whose boundaries are "the *reliability of the channel estimate*" and "*arithmetic*"; `chapters/ch03_objectives.tex`, §Two Research Questions.

## The experimental ladder

| Layer | Conditions | Classical comparator | Main result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Memoryless, known channel, perfect CSI | Symbol-wise DF, zero parameters | **Classical wins.** DF $0.1218$ against the MLP's $0.1229$ at 8 dB; the learned relay only matches DF, at 169 parameters against none |
| 2 | + 3-tap ISI, CSI still perfect | Viterbi MLSE with exact taps | **Split.** DF rises from $0.1802$ at 8 dB to $0.2457$ at 20 dB; the MLP restores the link ($0.0065$ at 8 dB) but genie-CSI Viterbi leads by 1–1.5 dB ($0.0072$) |
| 3 | + finite pilot budget | Pilot-aided LS estimate, then MLSE | **Crossover.** At 10 dB, Viterbi-est holds $0.0283$ on 200 pilots and $0.0335$ on 20, both beating the pilot-free MLP's $0.0486$; by 10 pilots it degrades to $0.0545$ and the MLP leads |
| 4 | + unseen realization from the trained family, redrawn per block | CMA blind equalization | **Learned relay wins.** At 20 dB the MLP reaches $0.00262$ against CMA's $0.00329$; decision-directed blind MLSE is unstable and worse at 20 dB ($0.0498$) than at 16 dB ($0.0374$) |

## Canonical experiment

Two-hop SISO link, i.i.d. per-symbol Rayleigh fading on both hops, complex baseband, Gray-coded QPSK, uncoded, with receiver-side CSI used for one-tap zero-forcing equalization; the relay function is the only variable. Eight strategies — AF and symbol-wise DF against MLP, Hybrid, VAE, Transformer, Mamba-S6 and Mamba-2 — as Monte Carlo estimates with 95% confidence intervals.
**Source:** `chapters/ch04_methods.tex`, §System Model; scope table `tbl:assumptions-claims` in `chapters/ch01_introduction.tex`.

**Result:** DF is best or tied-best at every reported SNR from 6 dB upward, at zero parameter cost. Learned relays match it rather than beat it; the sequence models trail at low SNR on this memoryless channel.
**Source:** `chapters/ch05_experiments.tex`, Table `tbl:table2` ("BER on the canonical setup"); Figure `fig:fig10`.

*"Fast fading" here means the strict memoryless case, $h[i]\sim\mathcal{CN}(0,1)$ drawn independently per symbol — not a process with a finite Doppler spectrum.*
**Source:** `chapters/ch04_methods.tex`, §System Model.

## Unknown-channel experiment — the principal contribution

Against an unmodeled three-tap ISI filter, both evaluated memoryless classical relays (AF and zero-threshold symbol-wise DF) fail outright, DF's error rate rising as transmit power grows. A 170-parameter windowed MLP restores reliable relaying, reaching $4.79\times10^{-8}$ by 16 dB.
**Source:** `chapters/ch07_unknown_and_mismatch_channels.tex`, chapter opening; Figure `fig:figE6`.

The high-SNR floor of $0.25$ belongs to the evaluated detector and this tap vector, not to ISI in general: it is $k/4$ with $k$ the number of negative amplitudes $A(s_1,s_2)$, here one.
**Source:** `chapters/ch07_unknown_and_mismatch_channels.tex`, Eq. `eq:slicer-floor` and the two caveats following it.

The claim is bounded deliberately: *"The evaluated zero-threshold symbol-wise slicer cannot compensate for the selected ISI channel at any transmit power"* — which does not exclude symbol-by-symbol MAP detection.
**Source:** `chapters/ch07_unknown_and_mismatch_channels.tex`, chapter opening.

## Blind / unseen-realization regime

The relay receives no per-block channel estimate and never adapts online, but is trained and tested within the same parametric impairment family; layers 3 and 4 redraw realizations from that family.

> The supported claim is therefore **realization-agnostic**, not family-agnostic: the relay amortizes the family distribution into its weights, and generalization to a structurally different family is not tested.

**Source:** `chapters/ch07_unknown_and_mismatch_channels.tex`, §Layer-2 baselines paragraph (verbatim).

## Model size

A size sweep replicated over three initializations locates the smallest relay that costs nothing measurable and shows channel memory, not parameter count, sets it: four parameters suffice on the memoryless channel while the evaluated three-tap channels need 73 to 145 and a window spanning the interference. The median across-initialization spread over 152 configurations is $0.180$ dB, and no upward arm clears it.
**Source:** `chapters/appendices.tex`, §Appendix E, Table `tbl:seed-spread`; `chapters/ch08_discussion.tex`, §Does the Complexity Curve Turn Upward?

One architecture is unstable: the Transformer's across-initialization spread at the 3K budget is $0.906$ dB, five times the rest, traced to a single non-converged run in eight.

## Cost

Under the MAC-counting convention adopted in the thesis, full-state Viterbi MLSE requires $2M^{L}$ MAC-equivalents per symbol over $M^{L-1}$ states, against a learned relay's $O(LH)$ — linear against exponential in the memory. The two are equal near $L^{\star}=3.35$ taps for the deployed architecture: an arithmetic crossover at fixed $(W,H,M)$, not a universal threshold.

## Conclusion

Classical processing remains preferable when its model assumptions are satisfied. A compact learned relay becomes attractive when channel memory, model mismatch, or unreliable channel estimation makes the *evaluated* classical processing chain poorly matched to the channel.

## What this thesis does not claim

- **Not a verdict on classical receiver design.** The comparators are the specific pipelines implemented here; reduced-state sequence estimation, decision feedback and hybrid model-based detectors were not evaluated. **Source:** `chapters/ch01_introduction.tex`, Table `tbl:assumptions-claims`, row "Comparator knowledge".
- **No generalization outside the trained impairment family.** **Source:** `chapters/ch07_unknown_and_mismatch_channels.tex`, "realization-agnostic, not family-agnostic".
- **No MIMO, no multiple relays, no full duplex, no constellation denser than 16-QAM as a relay question.** **Source:** `chapters/ch01_introduction.tex`, Table `tbl:assumptions-claims`, row "Channel".
- **No hardware, quantization or energy validation.** Parameter count bounds none of these. **Source:** `chapters/ch08_discussion.tex`, §Deployment footprint.
- **No confirmatory statistics.** Comparisons were not prespecified, no multiplicity correction is applied, and intervals cover Monte Carlo realizations at fixed weights rather than training-seed variability. **Source:** `chapters/ch04_methods.tex`, §Statistical Significance Testing.
- **Viterbi is not a BER bound.** MLSE minimizes sequence error; the BER-optimal comparator is bit-MAP/BCJR, measured at QPSK only and unmeasured at BPSK. **Source:** `chapters/ch07_unknown_and_mismatch_channels.tex`, §A BER-Optimal Benchmark: BCJR/APP Against Viterbi MLSE.

## Repository and build

This tree is **generated**. The source is `thesis/` in `Gilzuk/relaynet2`, and `scripts/overleaf_sync.py` there rebuilds it in full on every publish — anything changed here directly is overwritten at the next publish. `thesis.pdf` is build output, not a source; it is named `thesis.pdf` rather than `main.pdf` because Overleaf writes its own `main.pdf` when it compiles.

Compile with **XeLaTeX**, not pdfLaTeX — `fontspec` and `polyglossia` (the Hebrew abstract) require it. See `OVERLEAF.md` for the font and package-order notes.
